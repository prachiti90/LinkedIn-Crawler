# LinkedIn-Crawler

This crawler was built in python using the LinkedIn API to scrape the 
data for all the companies belonging to the "Staffing and Recruiting" Industry, present in Indiia.

## Resources
 * [LinkedIn API Docs](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs)
 * [Rest Console](https://apigee.com/console/linkedin)
 
 I found the Rest Console to be the most helpful. You can execute your query/search string and see if it is valid or not.
 
 But before that be sure to read th LinkedIn API Documentation carefully. 
 Specially the Profile Field Descriptions to find out all the parameters you can fetch or search with a request.
 
 You can use my API for temporary basis only.
